# Words Quiz App

## Description
This project is a game that tests your knowledge of syntactic types of words. You will be presented with a series of questions and you need to choose the correct syntactic type for each word. Once you select an answer, you cannot modify it. The next question will be displayed immediately after you make a choice. Your progress will be shown in a progress bar. After answering all the questions, you will receive a rank. If you wish to play again, you can start from the beginning with a different set of words.
